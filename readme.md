<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]]

Hi there, I just beginner in this JAVA language. I have created this simple JAVA project which called Viral Email. This project will let you send your email to multiple address instantly using SMTP protocol. However, this project is just for demo only. So, there will be some certain limitation.

Some limitation is:
* For now, this project can work on with an account from Gmail and Yahoo only
* To login your email account, it would need the App Password generated from your account security settings
* A list of addresses can be read from `.txt` file only

Of course, there is not much feature inside this project. However, I have put the basic concept on how to create a simple email sender program using JavaMail API.

Feel free to go through this project. I hope you guys can get some ideas about my project :smile:

### Built With

To create this project, I have been using several things which is:
* [Java8](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html)
* [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To start your project, you might need to setup your IntelliJ with Java8@JDK_1.8 integrated with Maven project management tool first.

### Prerequisites

You would need to make sure that you have these 3 libraries which is:
* JavaFX (Doesn't need to install since Java 8 already have)
* JavaMail
* Java Activation Framework (JAF)

### Installation

Since this project were using Maven, you will only need to open the `pom.xml` files inside your IntelliJ and all the setup will be configured by the Maven.
